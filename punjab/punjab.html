    <p>Punjab is Pakistan's second largest province by area after Balochistan with an area of 205,344 square kilometres (79,284 square miles).[70] It occupies 25.8% of the total landmass of Pakistan.[70] Punjab province is bordered by Sindh to the south, the province of Balochistan to the southwest, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west, and the Islamabad Capital Territory and Azad Kashmir in the north. Punjab borders Jammu and Kashmir in the north, and the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east.

        The capital and largest city is Lahore which was the capital of the wider Punjab region since 17th century. Other important cities include Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, Sialkot, Bahawalpur, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Jhelum and Sahiwal. The undivided Punjab region was home to six rivers, of which five flow through Pakistan's Punjab province. From west to east, the rivers are: the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej. It is the nation's only province that touches every other province; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad</p>

    <h2 id="minarepakistan">Minar-e-Pakistan</h2>
    <img src="../images/minarepakistan.jpeg">
    <p>Minar-e-Pakistan is a historical monument in Lahore. It is considered as the largest tower in Pakistan. Minar-e-Pakistan is the place where Lahore resolution was passed which was the official call for a separate homeland for the Muslims of South Asia in the result of two nation theory. 

        Minar-e-Pakistan which is also known as the “Tower of Pakistan” is an open landmark placed in Iqbal Park in Lahore, Pakistan. The tower was built throughout the 1960s on the site where, on 23 March 1940, the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution, the first official call for a differentiate country for the Muslims living in the South Asia, as per the two country theory. The tower reflects a mix of Mughal, Islamic and present day structural engineering.</p>
    <h2 id="murree">Murree</h2>
    <img src="../images/murre.jpeg">
    <p>Murree is a hill station on the border between Punjab and Azad Kashmir in Pakistan.

        An American journalist Camile wrote, that, "Everything and anything can happen in Murree. Romance is in the atmosphere; intrigue is in the air. The roads to this happy holiday's resort embrace both the heaven and earth. In Murree it is easy to fall in love".
        
        Murree was once a charming colonial town nestled in the Himalayan foothills - but the last 15 years have seen rampant development and today Murree more closely resembles a litter-strewn overcrowded tourist resort. However it remains exceedingly popular with Pakistani families and still receives glowing recommendations from this demographic. For the international visitor heading further north to the Galis (e.g. Nathia Gali) may prove more rewarding. In summer it is cool - even chilly in the evening - while light rain is common. In winter Murree hides herself under thick blanket of snow, however few tourists visit at this time and most hotels and attractions will be closed.</p>
    <h2 id="islamabad">Islamabad</h2>
    <img src="../images/Islamabad.jpeg">
    <p>A modern planned city that is well-maintained and well-organised, Islamabad (Urdu: اسلام آباد) is Pakistan's clean, calm, and green capital. Founded in the 1960s, it attracts people from all over Pakistan, and hosts a large number of diplomats, politicians and government employees, making it one of the nation's most cosmopolitan and urbanized cities. Although it is only the country's ninth largest city, its metropolitan area (encompassing the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi) is the country's third largest conurbation, with a population of over 4.5 million. Lying on the Pothohar Plateau in the north-east, within the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), it is regarded as the most developed city in Pakistan.</p>
    <h2 id="multan">Multan</h2>
    <img src="../images/multan.jpeg">
    <p>Multan is one of the oldest cities in the Asian subcontinent. According to Hindu legends, it was the capital of the Trigarta Kingdom at the time of the Mahabharata war, ruled by the Katoch Dynasty. Its name is derived from the Sanskrit name Mulasthana named after a sun temple. Multan has frequently been a site of conflict due to its location on a major invasion route between South Asia and Central Asia. It is believed to have been visited by Alexander the Great's army.The city of Multan is in southern Punjab province at almost the exact centre of Pakistan. The area around the city is a flat, alluvial plain and is ideal for agriculture, with many citrus and mango farms. There are many canals that cut across the Multan District, providing water for nearby farms. This makes the land very fertile. However land close to the Chenab is usually flooded in the monsoon season.</p>
